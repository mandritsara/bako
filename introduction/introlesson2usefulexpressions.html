            <h3>Appendix: Malagasy Hospitality</h3>
            <p>There is a Malagasy proverb, “Valala iray ifanapahana,” which literally means, “we can share a cricket between us.” This expresses the idea of joy in sharing food.</p>
            <p>Another proverb, “Hani-masaka tsisy tompony,” means “the meal is ready for everyone.” Hospitality is a core part of Malagasy culture.</p>
