    <h2>About the Website</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Bako, and welcome to my website!</p>

    <p>I have been a language teacher in Mandritsara since 2008. Over the years, I have personally tutored many missionaries and visitors to the <a href="https://www.mandritsara.org.uk/" target="_blank">Hopitaly Vaovao Mahafaly Mandritsara</a> project.</p>

    <p>In Mandritsara, the local Tsimihety people have their own dialect. However, official Malagasy language is widely spoken and understood by most people.</p>

    <p>It is my firm belief that language and culture are intertwined.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="text-highlight">Understanding context is crucial to mastering Malagasy/Tsimihety.</span><br>
      <span class="text-highlight">Conversely, learning the language provides a window into the heart and soul of the people.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I thank God for this unique role despite my lack of teaching qualification. I am a scientist by training. My teaching method has been refined through years of careful study and observation, with plenty of helpful feedback from my students.</p>

    <p>This website is my attempt at committing to paper what I have gleaned over the years. Through these prepared lessons, I hope to provide a framework that will help future students master both Malagasy and Tsimihety.</p>
